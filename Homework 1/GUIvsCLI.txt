	The GUI or Graphical User Interface allows an easier way to interact with computer systems. Having more options than just text input can help facilitate faster adoption of a program for basic users. Using the mouse, having clickable, scrollable, and usable icons can be much simpler to work with for certain people. Having more color, easier to navigate options and feedback can make using applications much more ergonomic. Many people start out using the GUI first, so they are more familiar with it. Also has less chance of causing problems.

	The CLI or Command Line Interface is essentially the most direct way to interact with a computer system at the user level. Having the ability to do the same things that the GUI can do, but often with less keystrokes and more control. A user can develop scripts and use commands to get more detailed information about a system. Often, some terminals only have a CLI input option. There is a slightly taller learning curve to maneuver through and remember commands. There are more chances to disrupt the computer inadvertently, but also a user can have much more intricate control also.
